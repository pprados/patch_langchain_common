Recentadvancesindocumentimageanalysis(DIA)havebeen\\nprimarily driven by the application of neural networks.

However, various factors like loosely organized codebases\\nand sophisticated model configurations complicate the easy reuse of im-\\nportantinnovationsbyawideaudience.Thoughtherehavebeenon-going\\nefforts to improve reusability and simplify deep learning (DL) model\\ndevelopmentindisciplineslikenaturallanguageprocessingandcomputer\\nvision, none of them are optimized for challenges in the domain of DIA.\\nThis represents a major gap in the existing toolkit, as DIA is central to\\nacademicresearchacross awiderangeof disciplinesinthesocialsciences\\nand humanities. This paper introduces LayoutParser, an open-source\\nlibrary for streamlining the usage of DL in DIA research and applica-\\ntions. The core LayoutParser library comes with a set of simple and\\nintuitiveinterfacesforapplyingandcustomizingDLmodelsforlayoutde-\\ntection,characterrecognition,andmanyotherdocumentprocessingtasks.\\nTo promote extensibility, LayoutParser also incorporates a community\\nplatform for sharing both pre-trained models and full document digiti-\\nzation pipelines. We demonstrate that LayoutParser is helpful for both\\nlightweight and large-scale digitization pipelines in real-word use cases.\\nThe library is publicly available at https://layout-parser.github.io.\\nKeywords: DocumentImageAnalysis·DeepLearning·LayoutAnalysis\\n· Character Recognition · Open Source library · Toolkit.\\n1 Introduction\\nDeep Learning(DL)-based approaches are the state-of-the-art for a wide range of\\ndocumentimageanalysis(DIA)tasksincludingdocumentimageclassification[11,\\n1202 nuJ 12  ]VC.sc[  2v84351.3012:viXra\\n\\x0c2 Z. Shen et al.\\n37], layout detection [38, 22], table detection [26], and scene text detection [4].\\nA generalized learning-based framework dramatically reduces the need for the\\nmanualspecificationofcomplicatedrules,whichisthestatusquowithtraditional\\nmethods. DL has the potential to transform DIA pipelines and benefit a broad\\nspectrum of large-scale document digitization projects.\\nHowever, there are several practical difficulties for taking advantages of re-\\ncent advances in DL-based methods: 1) DL models are notoriously convoluted\\nfor reuse and extension. Existing models are developed using distinct frame-\\nworks like TensorFlow [1] or PyTorch [24], and the high-level parameters can\\nbe obfuscated by implementation details [8]. It can be a time-consuming and\\nfrustrating experience to debug, reproduce, and adapt existing models for DIA,\\nand many researchers who would benefit the most from using these methods lack\\nthe technical background to implement them from scratch. 2) Document images\\ncontain diverse and disparate patterns across domains, and customized training\\nis often required to achieve a desirable detection accuracy. Currently there is no\\nfull-fledged infrastructure for easily curating the target document image datasets\\nand fine-tuning or re-training the models. 3) DIA usually requires a sequence of\\nmodelsandotherprocessingtoobtainthefinaloutputs.Oftenresearchteamsuse\\nDL models and then perform further document analyses in separate processes,\\nand these pipelines are not documented in any central location (and often not\\ndocumented at all). This makes it difficult for research teams to learn about how\\nfull pipelines are implemented and leads them to invest significant resources in\\nreinventing the DIA wheel.\\nLayoutParserprovidesaunifiedtoolkittosupportDL-baseddocumentimage\\nanalysisandprocessing.Toaddresstheaforementionedchallenges,LayoutParser\\nis built with the following components:\\n1. Anoff-the-shelftoolkitforapplyingDLmodelsforlayoutdetection,character\\nrecognition, and other DIA tasks (Section 3)\\n2.

A DL model hub and community platform for the easy sharing, distribu-\\ntion, and discussion of DIA models and pipelines, to promote reusability,\\nreproducibility, and extensibility (Section 4)\\nThe library implements simple and intuitive Python APIs without sacrificing\\ngeneralizability and versatility, and can be easily installed via pip. Its convenient\\nfunctions for handling document image data can be seamlessly integrated with\\nexisting DIA pipelines. With detailed documentations and carefully curated\\ntutorials, we hope this tool will benefit a variety of end-users, and will lead to\\nadvances in applications in both industry and academic research.\\nLayoutParser is well aligned with recent efforts for improving DL model\\nreusability in other disciplines like natural language processing [8, 34] and com-\\nputer vision [35], but with a focus on unique challenges in DIA.

Section 2 provides an overview\\nof related work. The core LayoutParser library, DL Model Zoo, and customized\\nmodel training are described in Section 3, and the DL model hub and commu-\\nnity platform are detailed in Section 4. Section 5 shows two examples of how\\nLayoutParser can be used in practical DIA projects, and Section 6 concludes.\\n2 Related Work\\nRecently,variousDLmodelsanddatasetshavebeendevelopedforlayoutanalysis\\ntasks. The dhSegment [22] utilizes fully convolutional networks [20] for segmen-\\ntation tasks on historical documents.

The closest prior research to our work is the\\nOCR-D project7, which also tries to build a complete toolkit for DIA. However,\\nsimilar to the platform developed by Neudecker et al.

We now provide detailed descriptions for each\\ncomponent.\\n3.1 Layout Detection Models\\nIn LayoutParser, a layout model takes a document image as an input and\\ngenerates a list of rectangular boxes for the target content regions. Different\\nfrom traditional methods, it relies on deep convolutional neural networks rather\\nthan manually curated rules to identify content regions. It is formulated as an\\nobject detection problem and state-of-the-art models like Faster R-CNN [28] and\\nMask R-CNN [12] are used. This yields prediction results of high accuracy and\\nmakes it possible to build a concise, generalized interface for layout detection.\\nLayoutParser, built upon Detectron2 [35], provides a minimal API that can\\nperform layout detection with only four lines of code in Python:\\n1 import layoutparser as lp\\n2 image = cv2.imread(\"image_file\") # load images\\n3 model = lp.Detectron2LayoutModel(\\n4 \"lp://PubLayNet/faster_rcnn_R_50_FPN_3x/config\")\\n5 layout = model.detect(image)\\nLayoutParser provides a wealth of pre-trained model weights using various\\ndatasets covering different languages, time periods, and document types.

Shen et al.\\nFig.2: The relationship between the three types of layout data structures.\\nCoordinate supports three kinds of variation; TextBlock consists of the co-\\nordinateinformationandextrafeatureslikeblocktext,types,andreadingorders;\\na Layout object is a list of all possible layout elements, including other Layout\\nobjects. They all support the same set of transformation and operation APIs for\\nmaximum flexibility.\\nShown in Table 1, LayoutParser currently hosts 9 pre-trained models trained\\non 5 different datasets. Description of the training dataset is provided alongside\\nwith the trained models such that users can quickly identify the most suitable\\nmodels for their tasks. Additionally, when such a model is not readily available,\\nLayoutParser also supports training customized layout models and community\\nsharing of the models (detailed in Section 3.5).\\n3.2 Layout Data Structures\\nA critical feature of LayoutParser is the implementation of a series of data\\nstructures and operations that can be used to efficiently process and manipulate\\nthelayoutelements.Indocumentimageanalysispipelines,variouspost-processing\\non the layout analysis model outputs is usually required to obtain the final\\noutputs.Traditionally,thisrequiresexportingDLmodeloutputsandthenloading\\nthe results into other pipelines. All model outputs from LayoutParser will be\\nstored in carefully engineered data types optimized for further processing, which\\nmakes it possible to build an end-to-end document digitization pipeline within\\nLayoutParser. There are three key components in the data structure, namely\\nthe Coordinate system, the TextBlock, and the Layout. They provide different\\nlevels of abstraction for the layout data, and a set of APIs are supported for\\ntransformations or operations on these classes.\\n\\x0cLayoutParser: A Unified Toolkit for DL-Based DIA 7\\nCoordinates are the cornerstones for storing layout information. Currently,\\nthreetypesof CoordinatedatastructuresareprovidedinLayoutParser,shown\\nin Figure 2. Interval and Rectangle are the most common data types and\\nsupport specifying 1D or 2D regions within a document. They are parameterized\\nwith 2 and 4 parameters. A Quadrilateral class is also implemented to support\\na more generalized representation of rectangular regions when the document\\nis skewed or distorted, where the 4 corner points can be specified and a total\\nof 8 degrees of freedom are supported. A wide collection of transformations\\nlike shift, pad, and scale, and operations like intersect, union, and is_in,\\nare supported for these classes. Notably, it is common to separate a segment\\nof the image and analyze it individually. LayoutParser provides full support\\nfor this scenario via image cropping operations crop_image and coordinate\\ntransformationslikerelative_toandcondition_onthattransformcoordinates\\nto and from their relative representations. We refer readers to Table 2 for a more\\ndetailed description of these operations13.\\nBased on Coordinates, we implement the TextBlock class that stores both\\nthe positional and extra features of individual layout elements. It also supports\\nspecifyingthereadingordersviasettingtheparentfieldtotheindexoftheparent\\nobject. A Layout class is built that takes in a list of TextBlocks and supports\\nprocessingtheelementsinbatch.Layoutcanalsobenestedtosupporthierarchical\\nlayout structures. They support the same operations and transformations as the\\nCoordinate classes, minimizing both learning and deployment effort.\\n3.3 OCR\\nLayoutParser provides a unified interface for existing OCR tools. Though there\\naremanyOCRtoolsavailable,theyareusuallyconfigureddifferentlywithdistinct\\nAPIs or protocols for using them. It can be inefficient to add new OCR tools into\\nanexistingpipeline,anddifficulttomakedirectcomparisonsamongtheavailable\\ntools to find the best option for a particular project. To this end, LayoutParser\\nbuilds a series of wrappers among existing OCR engines, and provides nearly\\nthe same syntax for using them. It supports a plug-and-play style of using OCR\\nengines, making it effortless to switch, evaluate, and compare different OCR\\nmodules:\\n1 ocr_agent = lp.TesseractAgent()\\n2 # Can be easily switched to other OCR software\\n3 tokens = ocr_agent.detect(image)\\nThe OCR outputs will also be stored in the aforementioned layout data\\nstructures and can be seamlessly incorporated into the digitization pipeline.\\nCurrently LayoutParser supports the Tesseract and Google Cloud Vision OCR\\nengines.\\nLayoutParseralsocomeswithaDL-basedCNN-RNNOCRmodel[6]trained\\nwith the Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) loss [10]. It can be used\\nlike the other OCR modules, and can be easily trained on customized datasets.\\n13 This is also available in the LayoutParser documentation pages.\\n\\x0c8 Z.

LayoutParser supports exporting layout data into different\\nformats like JSON, csv, and will add the support for the METS/ALTO XML\\nformat 14 . It can also load datasets from layout analysis-specific formats like\\nCOCO [38] and the Page Format [25] for training layout models (Section 3.5).\\nVisualization of the layout detection results is critical for both presentation\\nand debugging. LayoutParser is built with an integrated API for displaying the\\nlayoutinformationalongwiththeoriginaldocumentimage.ShowninFigure3,it\\nenablespresentinglayoutdatawithrichmetainformationandfeaturesindifferent\\nmodes. More detailed information can be found in the online LayoutParser\\ndocumentation page.\\n3.5 Customized Model Training\\nBesides the off-the-shelf library, LayoutParser is also highly customizable with\\nsupports for highly unique and challenging document analysis tasks. Target\\ndocument images can be vastly different from the existing datasets for train-\\ning layout models, which leads to low layout detection accuracy.

Mode I directly overlays the layout region bounding boxes\\nand categories over the original image. Mode II recreates the original document\\nvia drawing the OCR’d texts at their corresponding positions on the image\\ncanvas. In this figure, tokens in textual regions are filtered using the API and\\nthen displayed.\\ncan also be highly sensitive and not sharable publicly. To overcome these chal-\\nlenges, LayoutParser is built with rich features for efficient data annotation and\\ncustomized model training.\\nLayoutParser incorporates a toolkit optimized for annotating document lay-\\nouts using object-level active learning [32]. With the help from a layout detection\\nmodeltrainedalongwithlabeling,onlythemostimportantlayoutobjectswithin\\neach image, rather than the whole image, are required for labeling. The rest of\\nthe regions are automatically annotated with high confidence predictions from\\nthe layout detection model. This allows a layout dataset to be created more\\nefficiently with only around 60% of the labeling budget.\\nAfter the training dataset is curated, LayoutParser supports different modes\\nfor training the layout models. Fine-tuning can be used for training models on a\\nsmall newly-labeled dataset by initializing the model with existing pre-trained\\nweights. Training from scratch can be helpful when the source dataset and\\ntarget are significantly different and a large training set is available. However, as\\nsuggested in Studer et al.’s work[33], loading pre-trained weights on large-scale\\ndatasets like ImageNet [5], even from totally different domains, can still boost\\nmodel performance. Through the integrated API provided by LayoutParser,\\nusers can easily compare model performances on the benchmark datasets.\\n\\x0c10 Z.

Similar to many existing deep learning\\nlibraries, LayoutParser comes with a community model hub for distributing\\nlayout models. End-users can upload their self-trained models to the model hub,\\nand these models can be loaded into a similar interface as the currently available\\nLayoutParser pre-trained models. For example, the model trained on the News\\nNavigator dataset [17] has been incorporated in the model hub.\\nBeyond DL models, LayoutParser also promotes the sharing of entire doc-\\nument digitization pipelines. For example, sometimes the pipeline requires the\\ncombinationofmultipleDLmodelstoachievebetteraccuracy.Currently,pipelines\\nare mainly described in academic papers and implementations are often not pub-\\nlicly available. To this end, the LayoutParser community platform also enables\\nthe sharing of layout pipelines to promote the discussion and reuse of techniques.\\nFor each shared pipeline, it has a dedicated project page, with links to the source\\ncode, documentation, and an outline of the approaches. A discussion panel is\\nprovided for exchanging ideas. Combined with the core LayoutParser library,\\nusers can easily build reusable components based on the shared pipelines and\\napply them to solve their unique problems.\\n5 Use Cases\\nThecoreobjectiveof LayoutParseristomakeiteasiertocreatebothlarge-scale\\nandlight-weightdocumentdigitizationpipelines.Large-scaledocumentprocessing\\n\\x0cLayoutParser: A Unified Toolkit for DL-Based DIA 11\\nfocuses on precision, efficiency, and robustness. The target documents may have\\ncomplicatedstructures,andmayrequiretrainingmultiplelayoutdetectionmodels\\nto achieve the optimal accuracy. Light-weight pipelines are built for relatively\\nsimple documents, with an emphasis on development ease, speed and flexibility.\\nIdeally one only needs to use existing resources, and model training should be\\navoided. Through two exemplar projects, we show how practitioners in both\\nacademia and industry can easily build such pipelines using LayoutParser and\\nextract high-quality structured document data for their downstream tasks. The\\nsource code for these projects will be publicly available in the LayoutParser\\ncommunity hub.\\n5.1 A Comprehensive Historical Document Digitization Pipeline\\nThe digitization of historical documents can unlock valuable data that can shed\\nlight on many important social, economic, and historical questions. Yet due to\\nscannoises,pagewearing,andtheprevalenceofcomplicatedlayoutstructures,ob-\\ntainingastructuredrepresentationofhistoricaldocumentscansisoftenextremely\\ncomplicated.\\nIn this example, LayoutParser was\\nused to develop a comprehensive\\npipeline, shown in Figure 5, to gener-\\nate high-quality structured data from\\nhistorical Japanese firm financial ta-\\nbles with complicated layouts. The\\npipeline applies two layout models to\\nidentify different levels of document\\nstructures and two customized OCR\\nengines for optimized character recog-\\nnition accuracy.\\nAs shown in Figure 4 (a), the\\ndocument contains columns of text\\nwritten vertically 15, a common style\\nin Japanese. Due to scanning noise\\nand archaic printing technology, the\\ncolumns can be skewed or have vari-\\nable widths, and hence cannot be eas-\\nily identified via rule-based methods.\\nWithin each column, words are sepa-\\nrated by white spaces of variable size, Fig.5:Illustrationofhow LayoutParser\\nand the vertical positions of objects helps with the historical document digi-\\ncan be an indicator of their layout tization pipeline.\\ntype.\\n15 A document page consists of eight rows like this. For simplicity we skip the row\\nsegmentation discussion and refer readers to the source code when available.\\n\\x0c12 Z. Shen et al.\\nTodecipherthecomplicatedlayout\\nstructure, two object detection models have been trained to recognize individual\\ncolumns and tokens, respectively. A small training set (400 images with approxi-\\nmately 100 annotations each) is curated via the active learning based annotation\\ntool [32] in LayoutParser. The models learn to identify both the categories and\\nregions for each token or column via their distinct visual features. The layout\\ndata structure enables easy grouping of the tokens within each column, and\\nrearrangingcolumnstoachievethecorrectreadingordersbasedonthehorizontal\\nposition. Errors are identified and rectified via checking the consistency of the\\nmodel predictions. Therefore, though trained on a small dataset, the pipeline\\nachieves a high level of layout detection accuracy: it achieves a 96.97 AP [19]\\nscore across 5 categories for the column detection model, and a 89.23 AP across\\n4 categories for the token detection model.\\nA combination of character recognition methods is developed to tackle the\\nunique challenges in this document. In our experiments, we found that irregular\\nspacing between the tokens led to a lowcharacter recognition recall rate, whereas\\nexisting OCR models tend to perform better on densely-arranged texts. To\\novercome this challenge, we create a document reorganization algorithm that\\nrearranges the text based on the token bounding boxes detected in the layout\\nanalysis step. Figure 4 (b) illustrates the generated image of dense text, which is\\nsent to the OCR APIs as a whole to reduce the transaction costs. The flexible\\ncoordinatesysteminLayoutParserisusedtotransformtheOCRresultsrelative\\nto their original positions on the page.\\nAdditionally, it is common for historical documents to use unique fonts\\nwith different glyphs, which significantly degrades the accuracy of OCR models\\ntrained on modern texts. In this document, a special flat font is used for printing\\nnumbersandcouldnotbedetectedbyoff-the-shelfOCRengines.Usingthehighly\\nflexible functionalities from LayoutParser, a pipeline approach is constructed\\nthat achieves a high recognition accuracy with minimal effort. As the characters\\nhave unique visual structures and are usually clustered together, we train the\\nlayout model to identify number regions with a dedicated category. Subsequently,\\nLayoutParsercropsimageswithintheseregions,andidentifiescharacterswithin\\nthem using a self-trained OCR model based on a CNN-RNN [6]. The model\\ndetects a total of 15 possible categories, and achieves a 0.98 Jaccard score16 and\\na 0.17 average Levinstein distances17 for token prediction on the test set.\\nOverall, it is possible to create an intricate and highly accurate digitization\\npipeline for large-scale digitization using LayoutParser. The pipeline avoids\\nspecifying the complicated rules used in traditional methods, is straightforward\\nto develop, and is robust to outliers. The DL models also generate fine-grained\\nresults that enable creative approaches like page reorganization for OCR.\\n16 This measures the overlap between the detected and ground-truth characters, and\\nthe maximum is 1.\\n17 This measures the number of edits from the ground-truth text to the predicted text,\\nand lower is better.\\n\\x0cLayoutParser: A Unified Toolkit for DL-Based DIA 13\\nFig.6: This lightweight table detector can identify tables (outlined in red) and\\ncells (shaded in blue) in different locations on a page. In very few cases (d), it\\nmight generate minor error predictions, e.g, failing to capture the top text line of\\na table.\\n5.2 A light-weight Visual Table Extractor\\nDetecting tables and parsing their structures (table extraction) are of central im-\\nportance for many document digitization tasks. Many previous works [26, 30, 27]\\nand tools 18 have been developed to identify and parse table structures. Yet they\\nmight require training complicated models from scratch, or are only applicable\\nforborn-digitalPDFdocuments.Inthissection,weshowhow LayoutParsercan\\nhelp build a light-weight accurate visual table extractor for legal docket tables\\nusing the existing resources with minimal effort.\\nThe extractor uses a pre-trained layout detection model for identifying the\\ntable regions and some simple rules for pairing the rows and the columns in the\\nPDF image. Mask R-CNN [12] trained on the PubLayNet dataset [38] from the\\nLayoutParser Model Zoo can be used for detecting table regions. By filtering\\nout model predictions of low confidence and removing overlapping predictions,\\nLayoutParser can identify the tabular regions on each page, which significantly\\nsimplifies the subsequent steps. By applying the line detection functions within\\nthe tabular segments, provided in the utility module from LayoutParser, the\\npipeline can identify the three distinct columns in the tables. A row clustering\\nmethodisthenappliedviaanalyzingtheycoordinatesoftokenboundingboxesin\\nthe left-most column, which are obtained from the OCR engines. A non-maximal\\nsuppression algorithm is used to remove duplicated rows with extremely small\\ngaps.ShowninFigure6,thebuiltpipelinecandetecttablesatdifferentpositions\\non a page accurately.
