      "spectrum of large-scale document digitization projects.\n",
      "However, there are several practical difficulties for taking advantages of re\u0002cent advances in DL-based methods: 1) DL models are notoriously convoluted\n",
      "for reuse and extension. Existing models are developed using distinct frame\u0002works like TensorFlow [1] or PyTorch [24], and the high-level parameters can\n",
      "be obfuscated by implementation details [8]. It can be a time-consuming and\n",
      "frustrating experience to debug, reproduce, and adapt existing models for DIA,\n",
      "and many researchers who would benefit the most from using these methods lack\n",
      "the technical background to implement them from scratch. 2) Document images\n",
      "contain diverse and disparate patterns across domains, and customized training\n",
      "is often required to achieve a desirable detection accuracy. Currently there is no\n",
      "full-fledged infrastructure for easily curating the target document image datasets\n",
      "and fine-tuning or re-training the models. 3) DIA usually requires a sequence of\n",
      "models and other processing to obtain the final outputs. Often research teams use\n",
      "DL models and then perform further document analyses in separate processes,\n",
      "and these pipelines are not documented in any central location (and often not\n",
      "documented at all). This makes it difficult for research teams to learn about how\n",
