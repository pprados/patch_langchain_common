While it’s possible to reference the entire PDF, this isn’t practical if it’s more than two pages long. It’s better to indicate the specific page to display in the URL. Therefore, assistance is needed so that chunking algorithms can add the page metadata to each chunk. The choice of delimiter helps the algorithm prioritize this parameter.*"
